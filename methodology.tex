\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

Several sources of information will be mined for information. User blogs provide
a ground level view of their consumption habits. News articles could gauge how
much impact this industry makes in society.
%(arguing that if it's newsworthy, then it's something).
These articles will be mined and analyzed using Bourdieu's framework of
\emph{Habitus}.

Google search trends will be used to measure consumer interest of coffee.
Keywords related to coffee will be used.
