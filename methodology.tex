\chapter{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

I will attempt to answer these questions using Bourdieu's framework of
\emph{Habitus}. Articles from People's Daily (English) have been gathered for
this study. These articles will then be subject to content analysis, on the
lookout for recurrent themes.

People's Daily was selected because of its wide circulation in China, enjoying
significant readership and wide reach across the population. Public officials
and ministers have chosen to release official statements through this outlet.

In gathering articles, a simple search with the term "Starbucks" within the
\href{http://en.people.cn}{People's Daily
website}\footnote{\url{http://en.people.cn}} was performed, returning 81
articles, the earliest of which date back to August 2007. A small Python script
\ref{appdx:grab-link} was written to programatically download all these matching
articles. While all news articles since 2007 were downloaded for the dataset,
analysis was intentionally limited to stories within January 2010 until May
2016. Refining further, stories that did not happen within China's borders are
not included in the analysis. A complete archive of all downloaded articles and
this paper itself are available in my
\href{https://github.com/tsdmgz/sbux-rmrb}{GitHub
repository}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tsdmgz/sbux-rmrb}}. Sample articles
that were included and not included are in (TODO: appendix B?).

\section{On the case of Starbucks}\label{subs:case-of-sbux}

One may question, so why Starbucks? There are a number of competing coffee
chains in China knowin that Starbucks was not the first of its kind in the
Mainland.

There is the popularity aspect. Yes, there are other coffee chains like UBC
Coffee (TODO: TW based?), and Costa Coffee, but Starbucks is not known as yet
another coffee chain, but it is rather known as a famous coffee chain. They are
a place to be that sells coffee, rather than something that sells coffee that
offers itself as a place to be.
