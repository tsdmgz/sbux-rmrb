Ever since the Open Door policy was revealed to the world, China has experienced
numerous transformations. From the economy to society, from the dawn of the
information age to today's ``millenial generation'', China has come far and wide
from where they first started. Part of this transformation is the emergence of
the caf\'{e} and its companion product, coffee. In an analysis of news articles
from People's Daily through the framework of Boudieu's \emph{Habitus}, the data
demonstrates that the caf\'{e} culture has managed slowly integrate itself into
the daily lives of Chinese, particularly of the younger generation.
