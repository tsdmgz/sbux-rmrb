  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of western culture adoration on coffee consumption in Taiwan. A series of three studies was performed. In study 1, content analyses of customer interviews were used to obtain topics of value-related issues, including gathering places for western foreigners, foreign drinks and culture experience, popularity and value perception of residents from upper society, brand image, and well-developed western countries. A questionnaire survey was used in study 2, and results indicated that there exists a positive relationship between the desirability of foreign culture and the adoring of foreign value in coffee consumption. Study 3 employed a 2 × 2 field experiment design to explore the impact of product-of-origin and country-of-origin dimensions on the product preferences. From the results, it was found that the impact of foreign brands on the consumer preferences for coffee and green tea was higher than the impact of local brands. In addition, the strengths of foreign brand are superior to the local ones in coffee consumption. The results of this study indicated that western culture adoration was one of the key factors in determining the consumer decisions and preferences in drink consumption.},

  url = {http://dcollection.daegu.ac.kr/jsp/common/DcLoOrgPer.jsp?sItemId=000000022032},
  abstract = {China, since 1978, the year of implementing the reform and opening up policies, has been on rapid economic growth. With the economic growth and per capita income increase, the standard of living and quality of life are being improved. After solving the basic problems of food and clothing, the majority of Chinese have reached the stage of attention to 'importance of enjoyable life style.' Thank to this change of Chinese consumer’s perception and life style, the food service industry and beverage consumption in China have significantly increased as well. With the development of economy, China coffee market is also growing. American coffee brand, Starbucks has been introduced since 1999 and obtained a strong position in the coffee market. In addition to South Korea's Caffe Bene, Angel-in-us, Maan Coffee, Taiwan's UBC Coffee and Chinese independent brand, Sculpting in Time~Café Coffee shops are running their businesses in China. Currently the coffee market in China is expected strong competition between coffee brands in the near future because it is entering the growth phase over the introductory stage in a product life cycle. Under this circumstance, the South Korean enterprises need differentiated marketing strategies from competitors for their successful business in China. The purpose of this research is, first, to investigate the important selection attributes of coffee brand and the relative positions of major coffee brands on the positioning map through similarities and preferences of coffee brands that customers perceive. The second is to provide Korean coffee brands with strategic information about how to differentiate themselves from existing competitors in the Chinese market. The population of this study was coffee shop customers in Beijing, China. The survey was administrated from July 15th to July 25th, 2014. A total of 300 questionnaires were handed out and collected with 100\% response rate. After deleting incomplete responses, 268 effective responses were analyzed. Frequency analysis, descriptive statistics, t-test, ALSCAL and regression analysis were utilized to analyze the data using SPSS 21.0. The results showed that among 8 selection attributes (taste of coffee, price, brand, atmosphere, variety of menu, cleanness and sanitary condition, friendly service, convenient location and transportation), the most important attributes of selecting a coffee brand was atmosphere, followed by cleanness and sanitary condition and convenient location and transportation. Friendly service, taste of coffee, price and variety of menu were next and brand was the least important among 8 selection attributes. The results of ALSCAL identified that, Starbucks Coffee, UBC Coffee, Angel-in-us and Sculpting in Time~Café were close to each other on the positioning map, indicating that the respondents perceived them as competitors. On the other hand, Caffe Bene and Maan Coffee were found far away from others on the positioning map, indicating that they were perceived differentiated from other coffee brands. Based on the results of regression analysis, positioning map was derived, using evaluation score of the six coffee shops’ similarity information and 8 selected attributes. The results showed that Maan Coffee was evaluated as highest on atmosphere, cleanness and sanitary condition and convenient location and transportation, compared to other coffee brands. Angel-in-us got the highest score on friendly service and price. Caffe Bene was superior to other competing brands for variety of menu. In the case of Sculpting in Time~Café, most selected attributes were identified as less competitive than other coffee brands, except for taste of coffee. Starbucks has not gained a competitive advantage over Maan Coffee on other selected attributes except for taste of coffee and price. Overall, this study suggested how Korean coffee brands should emphasize the important selection attributes to Chinese customers in order to establish effective differentiation strategies in relation to existing competitors in the Chinese coffee market.},

  abstract = {The medicinal properties of coffee, making it a diuretic and stimulant, because of the effects of caffeine, have been known since ancient times, and coffee is today a popular beverage worldwide. In Japan it was introduced at the end of the eighteenth century through overseas trading with the Netherlands. During this period, various Western cultures flowed into Japan, and coffee was one of the subjects introduced through the translations of Dutch medical books. The pharmacological effects of coffee have been presented by Yamamoto in "Kōmō Honzou, (--, 1783)"; by K. Takahashi, G. Ohtsuki, and Y. Udagawa et al. in "Kōsei Shimpen (--, 1811)"; and by Kai Hirokawa in "Nagasaki Bunkenroku (--, 1795)." In the Chinese and Arabic traditional systems of medicine, the uses of coffee were based on its diuretic and central nervous system stimulant properties, attributed in general to caffeine. This study dealt with the uses of coffee in the traditional medicines of Asian countries and with some biological activities related to aging, infectious diseases, and cardioprotective effects. In various biological tests, the water extract of coffee showed no notable effect on myocardial cell beating; however, it did show superoxide anion-scavenging effects, inhibitory activity of lipid peroxidation, and suppression of hepatitis B virus surface antigen. These biological activities are closely related to the presence of caffeic acid derivatives, especially chlorogenic acid. The findings suggest that besides its stimulant effect, coffee has properties to prevent the deleterious actions of free radicals and viral infections.},

  abstract = {McDonald\&\#39;s restaurants are found in over 100 countries, serving tens of millions of people each day. What are the cultural implications of this phenomenal success? The widely readand widely acclaimedGolden Arches East argues that McDonald\&\#39;s has largely become divorced from its American roots and become a \&quot;local\&quot; institution for an entire generation of affluent consumers in Hong Kong, Beijing, Taipei, Seoul, and Tokyo. In the second edition, James L. Watson also covers recent attacks on the fast-food chain as a symbol of American imperialism, and the company\&\#39;s role in the obesity controversy currently raging in the U.S. food industry, bringing the story of East Asian franchises into the twenty-first century.  Praise for the First Edition:  \&quot;Golden Arches East is a fascinating study that explores issues of globalization by focusing on the role of McDonald\&\#39;s in five Asian economies and [concludes] that in many countries McDonald\&\#39;s has been absorbed by local communities and become assimilated, so that it is no longer thought of as a foreign restaurant and in some ways no longer functions as one.\&quot; Nicholas Kristof, New York Times Book Review  \&quot;This is an important book because it shows accurately and with subtlety how transnational culture emerges. It must be read by anyone interested in globalization. It is concise enough to be used for courses in anthropology and Asian studies.\&quot; Joseph Bosco, China Journal  \&quot;The strength of this book is that the contributors contextualize not just the food side of McDonald\&\#39;s, but the social and cultural activity on which this culture is embedded. These are culturally rich stories from the anthropology of everyday life.\&quot; Paul Noguchi, Journal of Asian Studies  \&quot;Here is the rare academic study that belongs in every library.\&quot;Library Journal},

  isbn = {978-0-691-09676-6},
  abstract = {From the first century, when Buddhism entered China, the foreign religion shaped Chinese philosophy, beliefs, and ritual. At the same time, Buddhism had a profound effect on the material world of the Chinese. This wide-ranging study shows that Buddhism brought with it a vast array of objects big and small--relics treasured as parts of the body of the Buddha, prayer beads, and monastic clothing--as well as new ideas about what objects could do and how they should be treated. Kieschnick argues that even some everyday objects not ordinarily associated with Buddhism--bridges, tea, and the chair--on closer inspection turn out to have been intimately tied to Buddhist ideas and practices. Long after Buddhism ceased to be a major force in India, it continued to influence the development of material culture in China, as it does to the present day. At first glance, this seems surprising. Many Buddhist scriptures and thinkers rejected the material world or even denied its existence with great enthusiasm and sophistication. Others, however, from Buddhist philosophers to ordinary devotees, embraced objects as a means of expressing religious sentiments and doctrines. What was a sad sign of compromise and decline for some was seen as strength and versatility by others. Yielding rich insights through its innovative analysis of particular types of objects, this briskly written book is the first to systematically examine the ambivalent relationship, in the Chinese context, between Buddhism and material culture.},

Therefore, the survey proved that the Chinese coffee consumption behavior is positively affected by the availability of quality coffee, use of coffee for socialization, attitude towards coffee and negatively associated by the price of coffee and age. Coffee preference from other hot drinks is influenced by attitude towards coffee, age, education \& quality coffee availability and it is negatively affected by price.},
