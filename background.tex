\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

China is famously known as a nation of tea drinkers. The coffee plant is not new
to China, making its appearance in Traditional Chinese Medicine as a medicinal
herb tasked to stimulating liver qi, purging the gallbladder, and regulating the
menstrual cycle \autocite{dharmananda_coffee_2003}.

\subsection{Statement of the Problem}

Given these items, Would Bourdieu's \emph{Habitus} be a suitable framework for
explaining the growing coffee culture in the country? Who are its primary
clientele? For what reasons do they drink coffee? Would they prefer to drink at
home or in a cafe?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Habitus as a framework
	\item Drinker demographics
	\item How did international franchises adapt
	\item How did the coffee culture start
\end{itemize}
