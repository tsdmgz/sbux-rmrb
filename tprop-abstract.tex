China is a rapidly emerging market for coffee consumption. Coffee, the fruit and
plant itself is not new to China, however, coffee drinking and its associated
culture is not. Coffee drinking culture boomed in China when Starbucks was
introduced to the country in 1999 and is quickly gaining ground among the
younger generation \autocite{harrison_exporting_2005}. Following this, several
formats of coffee preparation have been introduced
\autocite{euromonitor_international_coffee_2015}. Using Bourdieu's framework of
\emph{Habitus}, the study aims to have an in-depth study of the emerging coffee
drinking culture in China and Taiwan.
