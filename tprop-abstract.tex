\begin{abstract}

Ever since the Open Door policy was revealed to the world, China has experienced
numerous transformations. From the economy to society, from the dawn of the
information age to today's ``millennial generation'', China has come far and wide
from where they first started. Part of this transformation is the emergence of
the caf\'{e} and its companion product, coffee. Using news articles gathered
from People's Daily, the study will try to understand through the lens of
Bourdieu's Habitus how these establishments have managed to integrate themselves
into the daily lives of the Chinese and how it has managed to integrate itself
in China.
